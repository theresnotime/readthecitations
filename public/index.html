                    Other than it being easier than actually having to debate a topic intelligently,
                    when the majority of people say Wikipedia is "unreliable", they tend to be
                    referring to the fact that anyone can edit it, and that a nefarious individual
                    could

                <h3>How does Wikipedia combat this?</h3>
                <p>
                    Incidents of vandalism are <i>common</i>, but they are often removed within
                    seconds by

                <p>
                    Almost every statement of fact on Wikipedia has to be backed up by a

                    And they're right not to! Similar to how you wouldn't normally cite a print
                    encyclopaedia, directly citing Wikipedia has never been allowed — to be honest,
                    it's quite an odd

                    Smart students, however, <strong>read the citations</strong> and use those

                <p>
                    It's really simple: find a statement of fact in an article and click the little
                    blue number next to it — you'll be taken to the bottom of the page and the
                    relevant citation will be highlighted. (If the statement is in the article's
                    <span title="lede">lead</span> section or in the "infobox" on the right side, it
                    often won't have an inline citation; instead, check the appropriate part of the
                    article.)

                <h3>What if the cited source is unreliable or doesn't support the claim?</h3>
                <p>
                    Well first of all, you can now enjoy the smug satisfaction of telling your
                    friend not just that Wikipedia is unreliable, but that
                    <i>Wikipedia's source</i> is unreliable. Then, if you'd like to help, you can
                    fix the article. Make sure to use a descriptive
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Edit_summary" target="_blank"
                        >edit summary</a
                    >, so that your change isn't mistaken for vandalism. Say something like "Random
                    YouTube videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ aren't reliable
                    sources" or "Page 57 of Steven Chu's autobiography doesn't mention the scroll
                    lock key at all". If you are unable to edit the page because it is

                        >semi-protected</a

                    instead.
