                    Other than it being easier than actually having to debate a topic intelligently,
                    when the majority of people say Wikipedia is "unreliable", they tend to be
                    referring to the fact that anyone can edit it, and that a nefarious individual
                    could

                <h3>How does Wikipedia combat this?</h3>
                <p>
                    Incidents of vandalism are <i>common</i>, but they are often removed within
                    seconds by

                    And they're right not to! Similar to how you wouldn't normally cite a print

                    it's quite an odd

                    It's really simple: find a statement of fact in an article and click the little
                    blue number next to it — you'll be taken to the bottom of the page and the
                    relevant citation will be highlighted.

                <p>
                    Well first of all, you can now enjoy the smug satisfaction of telling your friend
                    not just that Wikipedia is unreliable, but that <i>Wikipedia's source</i> is
                    unreliable. Then, if you'd like to help, you can fix the article. Make sure to use
                    a descriptive
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Edit_summary"

                       >edit summary</a
                    >, so that your change isn't mistaken for vandalism.  Say something like "Random YouTube
                    videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ aren't reliable sources" or
                    "Page 57 of Steven Chu's autobiography doesn't mention the scroll lock key at all".
                    If you are unable to edit the page because it is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Semi-protection"
                       target="_blank"
                       >semi-protected</a
                    >, there will be instructions in the editing window on how to request an edit instead.
